2.  Go inside Httpd internal configuration file , In this file we can create custom documentRoot, "/etc/httpd/conf.d" this httpd Default configuration file location:


        #cd /etc/httpd/conf.d

3. Create own name or custom name folder inside Httpd configuration file("/etc/httpd/conf.d"), i am creating "my.conf" file & in this file i put my custom documentRoot:

   my.conf file put :-->  DocumentRoot  /var/www/pratik


        #vi  my.conf

Now apache web server read from this filder , It means from browser we connect this apache filder & in this folder we deploy own webpages.
